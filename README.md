# HACKATHON 2019

Background

Hackathon participants will create and populate a small (10-100MB) data lake in the cloud with flat files and/or semi-structured data (files should be KB/MB in scale). They will then create tools and user interfaces for exploring, manipulating and visualizing the data. 

Contribution

I created csv file containing list of high schools and then uploaded to JSON format.

I imported all of my data containing university list and then saved that file as a .csv format. Function i wrote can convert csv file into JSON file.

Also  i tested if my files are identical or not by using fs-equal function.
